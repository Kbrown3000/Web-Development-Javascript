JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that is simply a mechanism to add logic and interactivity 
to static browsers. In the years since its introduction, it has not only supplanted a variety 
of other competing languages and technologies to become the standard for browser-based programming, 
but it has also expanded beyond the client space to become a dominant language on the server side, as well.

JavaScript can be used for Hyper Text Transport Protocol, or HTTP, and was designed to do exactly what 
the name implies, which is to transport HTML text across a network for viewing. But the problem with HTML is
that it is completely static, providing no capabilities to implement logic. Basic features we currently take 
for granted, such as input validation, autocorrect, progress bars or causing a graphic to change during a mouse
rollover, would all be impossible for a browser to perform without some type of scripting capability. As a result,
when the web first rose to prominence, every vendor in that space provided some mechanism to make HTML web pages 
more interactive.

HTML provides a special <SCRIPT> tag that enables developers to embed JavaScript within the markup of the page.
Variable declaration using the var keyword in JavaScript is very straightforward and does not involve a complex 
set of initialization rules as one might see in Java or C++. JavaScript is known as an untyped language, which 
means that variables can take on a variety of different forms as a program executes.

For example, in the following program, a variable named greeting is declared and is initialized to a text string.
But, on the next line, the greeting variable is assigned to an integer value of 10. A new variable named product 
is then initialized to the value of the greeting variable multiplied by itself.

var greeting = 'Hello World';
greeting = 10;
var product = greeting * greeting;


In this repository I have created some programs using javascript to enhance my programming skills and to share the
knowledge with others while following the copyright laws as outlined in the license agreement attached.
